### 'Apartment Prices in Tirana' Project

**Description**:

The "Apartment Prices in Tirana" project analyzes real estate data to uncover trends and factors influencing apartment prices in the city. 
By collecting and examining data on apartment features, locations, and market conditions, the project employs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key pricing determinants. 
Machine learning models are applied to predict apartment prices based on these insights, providing valuable recommendations for buyers, sellers, and real estate investors. 
Ultimately, the project aims to enhance understanding of the Tirana housing market and support informed decision-making.
